        <h4> Suez Canal reopens after giant stranded ship is freed </h4>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews.
Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers.
Hundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. How was the ship freed?
Salvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility.
A Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given.
Dredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship.

            <h4> Macron Orders COVID-19 Lockdown Across All of France, Closes Schools </h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12"> With the death toll nearing 100,000, intensive care units in the hardest-hit regions at breaking point and a slower-than-planned vaccine rollout, Macron was forced to abandon his goal of keeping the country open to protect the economy."We will lose control if we do not move now," the president said in a televised address to the nation.His announcement means that movement restrictions already in place for more than a week in Paris, and some northern and southern regions, will now apply to the whole country for at least a month, from Saturday.Departing from his pledge to safeguard education from the pandemic, Macron said schools will close for three weeks after this weekend. </p>
